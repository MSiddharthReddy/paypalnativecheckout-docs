# Dragons Ahead

This is a development preview. If you are a new merchant looking to integrate with PayPal today, please see our Developer Documentation Portal for our v.Zero Express Checkout integration, or other options that maybe available to you.
This preview targets existing *non* V.zero merchants whose apps are basically an embedded webview experience today. It helps take the paypal flow out of the webview and put it in a browser based view and once Paypal checkout is done, will bring back the merchant's app experience into webview (as it was originally intended).
